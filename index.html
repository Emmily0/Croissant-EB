    🇫🇷 A French Pastry Delight 🇫🇷
    </h1>
        <p class="definition">A croissant is a buttery, flaky, and crescent-shaped pastry originating from France, made with layers of leavened dough. 
        </br>
        Interestingly, its roots trace back to Austria, where the crescent-shaped **"kipferl"** inspired this French classic. 
    </p>
   
    <p class="definition">Today, the croissant is a symbol of French culture and baking excellence.
</br>
It is a popular choice for breakfast or as a snack, enjoyed plain or filled with sweet or savory ingredients.</p>  

<p class="definition">Almond croissants, chocolate-filled **pain au chocolat**, or savory variations like ham and cheese croissants are just a few ways people around the world enjoy this versatile pastry.</p>
